# Library

The Library in Clutch holds all of the components available for your project.
Consuming or using a component from the Library creates an instance of that component in your composition tree.

The Library displays your project components and any installed packages in your project.
Each package will contain components that you can add to your composition.
If you cannot find the component you are looking for, search for it in the [Marketplace](/basics/bar/primitives).

To add a component to your composition, drag it from the Library onto your composition tree.
You can also search for components by name and filter them by package or category.

Utilizing the Library allows you to quickly build and manage your project's components, allowing for faster and more efficient development.
