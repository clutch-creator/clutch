# Canvas

The Canvas is the central block of the tool.
It will show all of the frames of the selected workspace if any exist.
The canvas is where you will edit your frames and their components with the composition and properties panel.

## Frames

Frames in Clutch are [iframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).
They are the entry points where your components will be loaded and rendered.
When you draw or create a Frame, you are creating a reference to a screen size that you want to see your components render in.
These sizes can range from mobile, tablet, and desktop to custom formats tailored to your desired deployment.

Your frames serve as a way to build your project/ application/ components visually and see how those items will render in a published versionâ€”allowing you to make changes and adjustments on the fly to fit your design.
