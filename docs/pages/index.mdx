## Installation:

You are now ready to build your first high-performant website.
## Quick Start Guide:



### Creating a project

1. Select the Minimal template from the templates section in the left-hand column to create a new project.
2. Once you have a new project open, it's time to add some content to your website.
3. Select the "Home /" page in the pages section.
4. Select the content section of the page in the composition panel (this is where we want to add per-page content).
5. Select the Text component from the toolbar.
6. Now change the properties of your text component using the properties panel. Set your tag to an h1 and change the text to your preferred text.

You have now created your first header text.

### Adding additional pages

1. Select the plus sign(+) next to the pages section. This will create a new site page. You will want to change the default path from "/page" to one that will better fit your needs, for example, "/contact."
2. Add some header text to the contact page as you added it to the home page.

Now that your site has two pages, add a navigation bar to navigate between them. 

### Adding navigation

1. Select the home page and then click on the layout section of the home page. Any components added to the layout will be available to all sub-routes. Placing the navigation will make it available on the contact page or any other sub-routes you add.
2. Add a block to the layout above the children slot so that the navigation appears above the content.
3. Add two links to the block (link components are in the toolbar).
4. Each link will have a nested text component that you can change to match your page routes, for example, home and contact.
5. On the link component itself, you will need to specify the href property to the page that you want that link to navigate to, for example, "/" and "/contact."

You now have created a way to navigate between your pages. Select the play button in the toolbar to interact with the links on the page.

### Styling the Navigation bar

1. Select the block component that has the navigation links.
2. Then using the container properties, set the direction to row (->), justify-content to end,
3. Next, add a gap by selecting the token icon from the gap property and choosing the space 8 (2rem).
4. You can add some padding by selecting the token picker in padding and choosing space 4 (1rem).
5. If you want to change the color of all the links, you can add a rule by selecting the plus button (+) in the styles section of the block.
6. Now change the rule to the letter "a." This will allow you to target and add styles to any of the links ("a" for anchor HTML tag) in the block.
7. Add a color property to the rule you created and add your own RGB, Hex, or HSV, or you can use the token picker to select from one of the color values from the theme.

### Adding page title, description, and other meta tags
