# Welcome to Clutch

## What is Clutch?

Clutch is an innovative website builder that combines the power of NextJS with a visual interface, enabling you to go from prototype to production in record time. With Clutch, you can design websites by visualizing components as blocks rather than lines of code, which saves you time and effort.

Clutch's componentization approach allows you to reuse the same features throughout your project, eliminating the need to rebuild them from scratch. This not only saves time but also helps maintain consistency and ensures that your website has a cohesive look and feel.

In addition to its visual interface, Clutch offers the option to code when necessary, allowing you to connect your website to a backend and perform database operations as needed. This means that even though you're using a visual builder, you're not limited to drag-and-drop components.

Clutch allows you to seamlessly integrate your website with your preferred backend technology, such as Supabase, Prismic, Node.js, Python, Ruby on Rails, or any other backend system. This makes it easy to build complex web applications with advanced functionality while maintaining the benefits of a visual website builder.

With Clutch, you have the freedom to choose the level of control you want over your website development process. Whether you prefer a visual approach or want to dive into the code, Clutch has you covered. Say goodbye to the hassle of coding and hello to the ease of Clutch. Build beautiful, responsive websites in a fraction of the time it takes with traditional web development methods. With Clutch, you can bring your ideas to life quickly and easily, no matter your skill level.
